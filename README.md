# LunaIRC
An IRC client in nodejs/electron

There is nothing actually in this application just yet....

## Building
To build & run:

```bash
npm install
npm run-script build
npm start
```

### TODO
* The package.json script needs some TLC.
* Settings need to be fleshed out and wired up.
* A /test command has been implemented

The test command connects to [EsperNet](http://www.esper.net/) with some hard coded defaults.
It also does not display any output to the output area.  Raw IRC is dumped to the console for now.
